# KO ESTIMATING CENTER — SESSION CHECKPOINT
# ============================================
# PURPOSE: Operational state for session continuity.
# RULE: Update after EVERY action, decision, or task completion.
# WHO UPDATES: Both Claude.ai and Claude Code sessions.
# READ THIS FIRST in any new session before doing anything.
# This is NOT the architectural doc (SESSION_STATE.md handles that).
# This is WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
# ============================================

## LAST UPDATE
- **When:** 2026-02-03
- **Updated by:** Claude Code
- **Session type:** BTX location bug investigation

---

## CURRENT BRANCH
- **Branch:** `main` (merged from sheet-first)
- **Pushed to remote:** ✅ YES
- **Latest commit:** `6c13a41` — "fix: remove location normalization - use raw names with spaces"
- **Backup tag:** `working-btx-2026-02-02` at commit `bd73385`

---

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISION (FINAL)
- **Going sheet-first.** Wizard will be eliminated.
- **Do NOT delete wizard code yet** — build new stuff first, prove it works, then remove.
- ~~Column A population unblocks everything — it's the critical path.~~ **DONE**

---

## ACTIVE TASK — BTX LOCATION BUG (BLOCKING)
- **Task:** Fix location matching between BTX/CSV and Sheet
- **Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED — Need to verify Python backend contract
- **Test project:** proj_56c795199df84c8e (Monday Again)
- **Test sheet:** 1MmF_trhCwHzEuSt9hcL1YgG2SaY3a1svndIUvl4IP3w

### Bug Analysis (Session 20g)
**Symptom:** CSV has `5TH FLOOR` but import fails to match.

**Root cause identified:**
- `btx/route.js:41` sends normalized locations (strips spaces): `5THFLOOR`
- Python backend generates BTX tools with normalized names
- CSV export has normalized: `MR-001VB | 5THFLOOR`
- Sheet header has spaces: `5th Floor`
- Mismatch causes 0 cells updated

### Files with normalization pattern
```
grep -rn "replace(/[^A-Z0-9]/g" --include="*.js"
```
| File | Line | Usage |
|------|------|-------|
| lib/google-sheets.js | 612 | FALLBACK - OK, keep |
| lib/google-sheets.js | 717 | FALLBACK - OK, keep |
| btx/route.js | 41 | PRIMARY - sends to backend |
| bluebeam/route.js | 93 | PRIMARY - builds locationMap |

### ⚠️ DO NOT FIX UNTIL VERIFIED
The Python BTX backend may EXPECT normalized format.
Must check backend contract before changing frontend.

### Files to check in next session
- `/home/iwagschal/aeyecorp/app/bluebeam/btx_generator.py` on VM
- `/home/iwagschal/aeyecorp/app/bluebeam/api.py` on VM
- What format does `generate_btx_with_locations()` expect?

---

## PREVIOUS ACTIVE TASK (COMPLETE)
- **Task:** CSV import with section-aware location mapping
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Test project:** proj_04ba74eb9f2d409a
- **Test sheet:** 1NO0I-cfshuhz1yUzSsWga5sJZpcwSEINbPeqYdy4O7A

### Test Results (Session 20e) — ALL PASS
| Item | Section | Row | Col | Status |
|------|---------|-----|-----|--------|
| MR-001VB | ROOFING | 4 | G | ✅ |
| MR-010DRAIN | ROOFING | 15 | K | ✅ |
| MR-022COPELO | ROOFING | 29 | H | ✅ |
| MR-033TRAFFIC | **BALCONIES** | 46 | G | ✅ **FIXED** |
| MR-037BRICKWP | **EXTERIOR** | 55 | G | ✅ **FIXED** |

### Fix Applied (Session 20e)
**Problem:** Single location→column mapping for all sections.

**Solution:** Function now reads each section's header row dynamically:
- ROOFING: row 3 → `{1ST FLOOR: G, 2ND FLOOR: H, ..., MAIN ROOF: K, STAIR BULKHEAD: L}`
- BALCONIES: row 45 → `{1ST FLOOR BALCONIES: G, 2ND FLOOR BALCONIES: H, ...}`
- EXTERIOR: row 54 → `{FRONT / ----ELEVATION: G, REAR / ---ELEVATION: H, ...}`

**Commit:** `bdcd567` — "fix: section-aware location mapping in fillBluebeamDataToSpreadsheet"

## COMPLETED THIS SESSION
1. ✅ Branch `sheet-first` created off `dev` and pushed to remote
2. ✅ Session 20 Task A complete — deployment verified live and healthy
3. ✅ Session 20 Task B complete — wizard elimination feasibility confirmed (kill ~2,079 lines, replace with ~150)
4. ✅ Architectural decision made — sheet-first, no wizard
5. ✅ Session continuity protocol established (this file)
6. ✅ **Template Column A populated with 53 item_ids:**
   - Script created: `scripts/populate-template-item-ids.js`
   - 32 ROOFING items (rows 4-43): MR-001VB through MR-032RECESSWP
   - 5 BALCONIES items + header (rows 45-50): MR-033TRAFFIC through MR-036DOORBAL
   - 16 EXTERIOR items + header (rows 54-72): MR-037BRICKWP through MR-051ADJVERT
   - All 53 cells verified populated
   - Committed and pushed to `sheet-first` branch
7. ✅ **Fixed section-aware location mapping (Session 20e):**
   - Root cause: `fillBluebeamDataToSpreadsheet()` used single location mapping for all sections
   - Fix: Now reads each section's header row (3, 45, 54) for section-specific location→column mapping
   - Added `TEMPLATE_SECTIONS`, `ITEM_ID_TO_ROW`, `getSectionForRow()`, `buildLocationMapFromHeader()`
   - Returns detailed match info for debugging
   - Committed: `bdcd567`
8. ✅ **Created `/api/ko/takeoff/[projectId]/sheet-config` endpoint (Session 20e):**
   - Reads takeoff config directly from Google Sheet (not wizard/backend config)
   - Returns: selected_items (51 items from Column A), locations (from section headers G-L)
   - Tested: 32 ROOFING + 4 BALCONIES + 15 EXTERIOR items correctly parsed
   - Committed: `d936577`
9. ✅ **Added "Generate BTX" button to Estimating Center UI (Session 20e):**
   - Button appears when project has takeoff sheet (embeddedSheetId exists)
   - Calls sheet-config → transforms to btx format → downloads BTX file
   - Location: `components/ko/estimating-center-screen.jsx`
   - Committed: `b403769`

## KEY CONTEXT FOR NEW SESSIONS

### If you're Claude Code starting fresh:
1. Read this file first
2. Read `docs/SESSION_STATE.md` for full architectural context
3. You're on branch `sheet-first`
4. Current task is in ACTIVE TASK section above
5. Do NOT touch `main` or `dev` branches
6. Do NOT delete wizard code until told to

### If you're Claude.ai starting fresh:
1. Read this file first
2. Isaac is the CEO, direct communicator, low tolerance for fluff
3. The KO platform is a roofing estimating system
4. We're building sheet-first approach on `sheet-first` branch
5. Check ACTIVE TASK for where we left off

### Critical references:
- Living state doc: `docs/SESSION_STATE.md`
- Template ID: `1n0p_EWMwQSqhvBmjXJdy-QH5B7KlRXP5kDhn3Tdhfk4`
- BigQuery dataset: `master-roofing-intelligence.mr_main`
