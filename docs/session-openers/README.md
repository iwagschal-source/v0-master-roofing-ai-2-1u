# SESSION OPENER DOCUMENTS
# These documents are pre-written briefings for each Claude Code session.
# Each opener tells the session exactly what to do, what NOT to do, and what to verify.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Start a new Claude session (Claude AI or Claude Code)
# 2. Paste the opener for that session number
# 3. The session reads ARCHITECTURE_BIBLE.md and MASTER_PLAN_v4.md
# 4. The session executes ONLY its assigned tasks
# 5. Before closing, the session writes a HANDOFF note at the bottom of its opener
#
# PARALLEL SESSIONS:
# Sessions 40-42 can run simultaneously (BTX, Import, Proposal)
# Sessions 43-44 can run simultaneously (Add Item, Tool Manager)
# ALL OTHER sessions must run sequentially
#
# COMPACTION CHECKPOINTS:
# If a session gets heavy, it should:
# 1. Commit all current work
# 2. Update the Architecture Bible
# 3. Write a HANDOFF note in its opener doc
# 4. The next session picks up from the HANDOFF
